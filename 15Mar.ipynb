    "a) Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, understanding natural language, and making decisions. AI is a broad field that includes several subfields, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: One example of AI is a chatbot that uses natural language processing to understand and respond to customer inquiries. Another example is an AI-powered image recognition system that can detect and classify objects in images.\n",

    "In machine learning, it is important to evaluate the performance of a model on data that it has not seen before. This is done by splitting the available data into three parts: training data, testing data, and validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data: This is the portion of the data that is used to train the machine learning model. The model learns the patterns and relationships in the data, and adjusts its parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output.\n",

    "Testing data: This is the portion of the data that is used to evaluate the performance of the model after it has been trained. The model is applied to the testing data, and its predicted output is compared to the actual output. The accuracy of the model is calculated based on how well it performs on the testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation data: This is an optional portion of the data that is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model.
